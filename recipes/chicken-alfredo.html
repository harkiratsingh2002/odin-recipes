    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast (boneless, skinless)</li>
        <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (freshly grated)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and slice thinly.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, melt butter over medium heat, then add minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream to the pan and simmer for 2-3 minutes until the cream thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan cheese and continue to simmer until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine pasta in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and add to the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly with the creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the Chicken Alfredo with the sliced chicken on top, garnished with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>
